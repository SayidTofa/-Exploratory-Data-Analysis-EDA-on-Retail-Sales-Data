## -Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-on-Retail-Sales-Data
##Description: 
In this project, you will work with a dataset containing information about retail sales. The goal is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can help the retail business make informed decisions.


## PROJECT OBJECTIVES:
Data Loading and Cleaning: Load the retail sales dataset.
Descriptive Statistics: Calculate basic statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation).
Time Series Analysis: Analyze sales trends over time using time series techniques.
Customer and Product Analysis: Analyze customer demographics and purchasing behavior.
Visualization: Present insights through bar charts, line plots, and heatmaps.
Recommendations: Provide actionable recommendations based on the EDA.


## Insights:
Data Overview: The dataset contains 1000 rows and 9 columns, including transaction details like Transaction ID, Date, Customer ID, Gender, Age, Product Category, Quantity, Price per Unit, and Total Amount.

Data Quality: The dataset has no missing values, ensuring completeness and reliability for analysis.

Product Category Analysis: The most purchased product categories are Clothing and Electronics, with Beauty being the least popular. Males tend to purchase more Clothing and Electronics, while females show a slight preference for Beauty products.

Revenue Insights: The total revenue generated from the dataset is 456,000 units, with the highest revenue coming from Clothing, followed by Electronics and Beauty.

Customer Demographics: The average customer age is around 41 years, with a standard deviation of 13.68, indicating a diverse age group.

## Recommendations:
Targeted Marketing: Focus on promoting Beauty products to female customers, as they show a higher preference for this category.

Inventory Management: Ensure sufficient stock for Clothing and Electronics, as these are the top-selling categories.

Customer Segmentation: Use age and gender data to create targeted marketing campaigns. For example, offer discounts or promotions to younger customers to increase sales in the Beauty category.

Revenue Optimization: Consider bundling products or offering discounts on lower-performing categories like Beauty to boost sales.

Data Visualization: Enhance visualizations by using more detailed charts (e.g., pie charts for product distribution) to better understand customer preferences and sales trends.
